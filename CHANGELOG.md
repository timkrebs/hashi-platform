# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
for the modules once they are tagged.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `aws-vpc` module: EKS-ready VPC with derived subnet layout, NAT options,
  load balancer subnet tags, input validation and plan-mode unit tests.
- `aws-eks-cluster` module: EKS control plane, typed managed node groups
  (capacity type, labels, taints), additional add-ons, EBS CSI driver with
  IRSA, input validation and plan-mode unit tests.
- `dev` environment root composing both modules against the
  `hashi-platform-dev` HCP Terraform workspace.
- GitHub Actions pipeline: static checks and speculative plan on pull
  requests, saved-plan apply behind environment protection on merge.
- Sentinel policy set under `infra/policies`: `require-mandatory-tags`
  (Environment, Project, ManagedBy on every taggable AWS resource) and
  `restrict-compute-size` (no instance type larger than medium), both
  hard-mandatory, with unit tests run in CI.
- Repository scaffolding: shared tflint configuration, pre-commit hooks,
  Makefile, editorconfig, gitattributes, issue and pull request templates,
  CODEOWNERS, Dependabot for actions and Terraform.
- Contributor documentation: README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY.

### Changed

- Replaced the copied EKS tutorial configuration (embedded provider, fixed
  CIDRs and node groups) with the two modules above.
- Node groups default to Amazon Linux 2023 images; Amazon Linux 2 images are
  not published for Kubernetes 1.33 and later.
- IAM roles created for the cluster and node groups use deterministic names
  instead of random suffixes.

### Removed

- Unused `random_string` resource and the `random` provider requirement.
